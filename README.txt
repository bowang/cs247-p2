Setup Instruction

Evader is designed to be played in a relatively dark room with weak or no light source. The game requires a projector to display the game scene and a webcam to capture and analyze the shadow of the user.

1) The projector should be placed around 6 to 8 meters away from an empty white wall.
2) The bottom border of the projected image needs to touch the intersection line between the wall and the floor.
3) Make sure the height of the projected image is taller than 2 meters.
4) The webcam should be placed around 50cm to 1 meter to the right of the projector and has to be be calibrated by the EVADER_ZOOM_LEVEL (default value is 2) in shadowboxing.js so that it should only see the exact area projected by the projector (the image frame captured by the webcam should align with the frame of the projected area).
5) Once the calibration is finished , make SHOW_RAW in shadowboxing.js  equals false (the default is true).
6) To play the game, load index.html and change the web browser in full screen mode.
